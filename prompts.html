<div style='margin: 0 21.5%; font-size: 1.125rem; font-family: trebuchet ms; text-align: left; user-select: text'>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspOrdinary human language is basically the newest programming language, and thoughtful prompt articulation is an increasingly useful or necessary skill for countless applications. Interactive NLP is more of an imagination & semantic logic puzzle for abstract programming approaches. Simply having the right questions on hand can be the main priority, which is apparent when finding out how much more useful distilling data from language you can provide it can be than obtaining data by other means. There's an entertainment value, but efficient prompt architecture is about cohesive, parsimonious steps to arriving at a predetermined objective.<br><br>

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIn most cases, vague questions result in more basic or generic results that could be obtained from a search engine. <i style='background: rgb(221,221,255)'>The key to the most productive approach to harnessing the power of these models involves collaborative work: iterative fine-tuning on behalf of a person who may have an intimate understanding of associated subject matters, and the AI making full use of memory + prompt-elicited knowledge & perspectives.</i> Each revision will mold the results, diverging from what anyone else would have asked. Optimal, exploitative answers may involve tapping into vast literature without years of studying, or compounding complex & sometimes unintuitive logical approaches.<br><br>

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspWhile avoiding redundancy, providing as much context as possible will faciliatate the curation of content to match what was intended. There is a landscape of contexts that interact with each other, each with associated weights, dimensions, and layers of perspectives to combine with others to potentially arrive at exponentially unique results. Variable quantities & qualities multiply with each other as the discussion takes different avenues of parameters. With such powerful models as ChatGPT, respecting the prompt sensitivity can yield results that are the difference between it declining to answer a question at all, and it giving a very creative and apt response.<br><br>

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe quest to improve prompt design is made easier by asking ChatGPT, which it can provide plenty of insight on without hesitation. For many questions it can be modest, stating it's limitations and providing ample disclaimers, which helps prevent trolls from finding a way to make it get taken down for everyone else. But by skillfully & creatively rephrasing questions, many of these issues can be addressed. Ultimately, the best prompts can be increasingly lengthy and also assist with getting answers fewer people have already uncovered.<br><br>

<img class='AILM1' src='cgpt4.png' alt='Image of ChatGPT response' width='298' height='298'/><br><br>

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspAnother useful concept is providing it information that you know is verified, and asking it to answer questions based only on that content, and to let you know if it cannot answer it with the given information. Obtaining verified, rigorous results can be one of the shortcomings of language models, thus arise options such as using shortcuts like force-feeding the data you want, or researching conclusions manually.<br><br>
