<p style='font-size: 2.5rem; font-family: walter turncoat'>Prompt Crafting Approaches for AI language models</p><p style='font-family: quantico'>Aaron S. | Jan 30, 2023</p><br>

<div style='margin: 0 10rem; font-size: 1.125rem; font-family: trebuchet ms'>The English language can basically be considered to be the newest programming language, and prompt articulation will prove to be an increasingly valuable skill relating to countless applications for the foreseeable future. In most cases, vague questions result in more basic or generic results that could be obtained from a search engine. One of the most productive approaches to harnessing the power from these models involves collaborative work: iterative fine-tuning on behalf of a person whom may have an intimate understanding of associated subject matters, and the AI making full use of memory and prompt-elicited knowledge & perspectives. Each revision can mold the results, diverging from what anyone else would have asked. Optimal answers may involve tapping into vast literature without years of studying, or compounding complex & sometimes unintuitive logical approaches.<br><br>

While avoiding redundancy, providing as much context as possible will faciliatate the curation of content to match what was intended. There is an entire landscape of contexts that interact with each other, with many dimensions and layers of sperspectives to combine with others to arrive at exponentially unique results. Variables multiply to go from 10x to 1000x different avenues with additional variables. With such a powerful model as ChatGPT, respecting the prompt sensitivity can yield results that are the difference between it declining to answer a question, and giving a very creative and apt response.<br><br>

The quest for improving prompt design is made easier by asking ChatGPT, which it can provide plenty of insight on without hesitation. For many questions it can be modest, stating it's limitations and providing ample disclaimers, which helps prevent trolls from finding a way to make it get taken down for everyone else. But by skillfully & creatively rephrasing questions, many of these issues can be addressed. Ultimately, the best prompts can be increasingly lengthy and also assist with getting answers fewer people have already uncovered.<br><br>
