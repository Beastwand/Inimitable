&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this article I highlight foods that meet <b>rigorous standards</b>, covering vast criteria such as <i style='background: rgb(221,221,255)'>the presence of antinutrients, being a source of diverse & bioavailable phytonutrients, vegan status, observed effect on aversion to disease, prevalence of various natural or artificial toxins, and lack of criticized salt/sodium, sugar or carbohydrates that influence the associated glycemic index or glycemic load.</i> In most cases it is the entire food. This list also does not include foods that are simultaneously praised and criticized (e.g. oatmeal, meat), as well as being subject to fluctuating opinions.<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A big theme of this article (and others of mine) are the risk versus reward, with (aside from allergies or something) virtually no risk, but substantial potential reward with research suggesting huge benefits. However, even if the reward turned out to be insignificant it's not much of an issue. Another way of wording this list of foods is the least criticizable foods, while still being meaningful sources of different types of nutrients. Foods aren't always on the list due to having the most of any given vitamin or mineral, but moreso because the caveats are almost nonexistant. This includes the wellbeing of animals. Many of these foods are part of the praised Mediterranean diet, which <a class='GCBlink' href='https://health.usnews.com/best-diet/best-diets-overall' target='_blank' rel='noopener'>has ranked #1</a> many years in a row by U.S. News & World Report<br><br>

<!-- This is either an introductory shortcut down the supreme nutrition rabbit hole, or a confirmation & elaboration regarding known foods of interest. There are so many classes of nutrients only found in particular foods any such type of vegetable.  -->

<span class='promptTitles'>Arugula</span><br><br>
<div class='blogArticleList'><span style='width: 56%'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vegetables in the same family as arugula ("Brassicaceae") are recognized as some of the healthiest foods in the world, but many of them contain high amounts of antinutrients. While there is a considerable amount of <i>oxalic acid</i> in foods such as spinach, chard and beet greens, in a research paper they did
<a class='GCBlink' href='https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10486698/#:~:text=arugula%2C%20cress%2C%20garlic%2C%20and%20green%20onion%20were%20some%20examples%20of%20aromatic%20plants%20which%20did%20not%20contain%20detectable%20oxalate' target='_blank' rel='noopener'>not report any</a> in arugula. While kale also hardly has any, it "can deplete iodine". Furthermore, Environmental Working Group's "Dirty Dozen" <a class='GCBlink' href='https://www.ewg.org/foodnews/dirty-dozen.php' target='_blank' rel='noopener'>includes</a> "spinach" and "kale, collard & mustard greens" as the most pesticide-contaminated produce after strawberries. It's a good idea to consume with something that contains fat, such as olive oil.<br><br>
<!-- In this case, the bitterness is arguably the plant defense, precluding antinutrients such as oxalic acid or lectins. If you diversify different leaf vegetables you're probably getting a variable of the same nutrients, whereas if you combine vegetables, berries, and legumes there's more nutrient diversity. Arugula with fat due to carotenoids? Consuming a lot of vegetables which are ~90% water is reasonable. -->

<div class='blogArticleList'><span style='width: 56%'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many sources consider nuts to be one of the best disease-averting foods, but many other types of nuts have lots of antinutrients (in this case lectins). While both in many ways are considered the best, there are measurements where walnuts slightly edge pecans when it comes to things like antioxidants. To further distinguish these nuts, peanuts (although not technically a nut) may contain aflatoxin and readily absorb pesticides.<br><br>

<span class='promptTitles'>Sunflower & Pumpkin Seeds</span><br><br>
<div class='blogArticleList'><span style='width: 56%'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sunflower/pumpkin seeds have concentrated amounts of many different kinds of nutrients. Fortunately, the issue of being a source of antinutrients can be addressed by "sprouting" them. They are a source of a vast amount of minerals, including the often scarce but essential magnesium & zinc alongside their associated cofactors. They make the tops of numerous lists of the best sources of many different nutrients.<br><br>

It is considered to have a high amount of oxalic acid, however. They are a <a class='GCBlink' href='https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/fdc-app.html#/food-details/2345316/nutrients' target='_blank' rel='noopener'>source of</a> very high amounts of vitamin K & beta-carotene (which acts as a provitamin A), and meaningfully high levels of vitamin C, folic acid, & potassium, as well as lots of minerals.

<div class='blogArticleList'><span style='width: 56%'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adding lemon juice to water can upgrade it in many ways, such as by adding electrolytes which can make it more hydrating. The water dilutes the acid that would otherwise be associated with damage to teeth. There is research (including <a class='GCBlink' href='https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7020168/#:~:text=)%20%5B47%5D.-,Table%207,Biological%20activity%20of%20C.%20limon%20fruit%20extracts%20confirmed%20by%20scientific%20research.,-Activity' target='_blank' rel='noopener'>this list here</a>) listing the beneficial effect lemon consumption can have when it comes to disease states, including cancer & diabetes .<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You may have not already been aware but caution is warranted as the combination of UV light from the sun and some plant substances (including lemon juice, among many others) can result in skin damage referred to as "phytophotodermatitis" (this is <a class='GCBlink' href='https://academic.oup.com/omcr/article/2019/11/470/5670819' target='_blank' rel='noopener'>more info</a> about it).

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obviously this list is not comprehensive, but there are many great foods that have some caveats to them, such as toxins (although many of which can be reduced by cooking). Other examples I may or will add to the list include <b>chickpeas</b>, <b>lentils</b>, <b>flaxseeds</b>, <b>avocados</b>, various types of <b>mushrooms</b>, <b>apple cider vinegar</b>, <b>brazil nuts</b>, <b>cacao</b>, and <b>nutritional yeast</b>.<br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although fish are a great source of nutrients, such as sockeye salmon, you can obtain the vitamin D3, DHA & EPA, and even astaxanthin from algaeâ€”the same source that the fish obtain itâ€”but with less mercury or cyanide. Also, there is evidence that eating meat may upregulate aging and inflammation (at least partly attributed to the high proportion of methionine & leucine in the protein).
